# Swift Projects
A repo for my friends and I to mess around with Swift in

# The Rules:

# One

You can request to join, but if I don't know you I probably won't accept it.

# Two 

If you do get accepted, don't add anything rude or offensive

# Three

This is totally collaboritive stuff, so work together and incorporate your own flavor into the repo! Have Fun ;)




# What This Repo is Trying to Accomplish

Why is a random collab repo just sitting out here collecting dust? Well, all of the programmers on here are mostly just starting to learn swift. I for one, will be documenting my projects as I learn it for the first time on here, and hope to show people that Swift is easy to learn, and if you want to give it a try, don't hesitate!
